/* 
 *  
 *  This code will deconstruct specific messages that are sent to the LEDS 
 *  This will inprove the speed in writing new LED actions as much of the difficulty actually comes from dectronstructing these values
 *
 * IMPORTANT !!!!
 * This class can only be used while the message pointer exists
 * This class must be destroyed at the same time since
 * this class does not generate any of its own dynamic mem
